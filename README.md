# NousInt
Derived from the classical concept of Nous, “intellect and direct awareness,” this project is designed to provide clarity within the noise of the web.

**NousInt is a centralized ecosystem for OSINT tools/resources, playbooks, and regulatory frameworks for everyone.**

# Project Background
Though originally created for the [GWC 2026 A.I x Cybersecurity Challenge](https://girlswhocode.com/PROGRAMS/GWC-CHALLENGES) in conjunction with [Hack Club's Sleepover Program](https://sleepover.hackclub.com/), this project has been something I have been wanting to create for a while (but did not have the push to).

Because I've been mega busy in 2026, there is vibe coding involved with this project especially with css/html; however, the underlying structure, logo, ui/ux ideation, and idea are 100% original.
