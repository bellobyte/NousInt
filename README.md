# NousInt

Derived from the classical concept of Nous, “intellect and direct awareness,” NousInt is designed to provide clarity within the noise of the web.

**NousInt is a curated catalog of OSINT and OPSEC resources, bringing reconnaissance tools, threat intelligence feeds, and privacy focused playbooks in one organized platform.**

We also have our own articles :D

This is an open source and ongoing project by bellobyte.

# GWC Challenge
This project addresses the GWC **Cybersecurity + AI Challenge** theme:

- **Problem**: AI-generated deepfakes threaten identity and trust, and many social media posts expose user PII which threaten user privacy. There is also lack of OSINT knowledge due to lack of structured knowledge bases.
- **Solution**: Use AI and a catalog of resources to detect and protect against AI-generated threats, from automated OSINT tools to mass surveillance, as well as human threat actors. 
- **Impact**: Empowers users to verify media authenticity before sharing, and protect their privacy through education!
# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash

git clone https://github.com/bellobyte/NousInt.git

cd NousInt

```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

3. Set up environment variables:
Copy the example environment file to create your own `.env` file:
```bash

cp .env.example .env

```
Open `.env` and fill in your API keys (Gemini, SightEngine, HuggingFace).

4. Run the application:
```bash

python main.py

```

And yes, I used AI to help a lot with advanced topics. It's pretty obvious, and I am not hiding it because I still learned and applied my knowledge from web security courses and programming classes! And who knew that deploying websites wasn't that hard all this time? not me :D
